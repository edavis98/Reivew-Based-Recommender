Then, we will use this information to inform our custom-built web scraper from which albums to scrape reviews from (URLs contain artist name and album name). Finally, we will save the scraped reviews and export the data into a .csv file for further examination and modeling in the next notebook titled `Review Analysis.ipynb`.\n",

    "- `$` is replaced with a `_` in the sole occurance across both artist and album names. If we update/expand the list, it might be wiser to remove the character all together as that occurs more often in other artist names that don't appear in this particular dataset. (joey bada$$ -> joey bada)\n",

Weird case, but so far I only noticed it for the Velvet Underground & Nico, which has the `&` removed in the artist name, but repalced by `and` in the album name. Odd and annoying.

    "- `+` is removed in all cases except for the artist 'catherine ribeiro + alpes', in which the + and whitespaces around it were replaced with 3 whitespaces\n",

    "- `-` is kept the same, as it already works for the url\n",
    "- `.` is a weird one. If it just at the end of a word, or at the end of the whole name, then it is removed. Otherwise, it's replaced with a `_`\n",
